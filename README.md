# Admin-Dashboard

This application is an Admin dashboard made in Laravel 8. Here you can create a new user and login with the default Laravel auth routes. Inside the application you have three 
kinds of pre-made roles. You can only see all the features if you are an Admin. While Admin you can:

- See a list of all users;
- Create new Roles and give them the proper permissions;
- Update and Delete existing roles;
- Create new Permissions;
- Update or delete existing permissions;

All users can access your profile, edit your personal data and even upload a profile image.

This application was made in this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-laravel-for-beginners-become-a-master-in-laravel).
